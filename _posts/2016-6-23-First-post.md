This is the first post.  I wanted to have a personal website and created this using Github pages. Also, this will be my tech blog.

But I am lazy enough not to continue this. Hope it will not go that way.

Yep, that is all for today.


This website was created with GitHub pages and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
